Overview
This acedemic project leverages the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset to explore various machine learning techniques, focusing on various data science methodologies, including unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis, as well as classification methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes. Each section outlines the methodology employed, addresses substantive issues encountered, and provides relevant literature to support the analysis. Additionally, the report includes a comparison of regression models, highlighting their performance through RMSE metrics. The findings aim to derive actionable insights and contribute to informed decision-making in the relevant field.
